    <h1>World's Population Visualisation</h1>
    <p1 class:"border"> As the years go by the population increases significantly. <br> This visualisation examines each
        country's population in relation <br> to their density, area, and other attributes. First, have<br> a look at
        the population of the countries<br>divided by color. </p1>

    <p2> Now let's take a look at a bubble chart <br> which represents countries' Growth Rate and density in relation to
        <br>
        their population and global rank. We can see that<br>
        some high density countries like <mark class="monaco">Monaco</mark> have relatively a<br>
        low growth rate. On the other hand, a country<br> like <mark class="moldova">Moldova</mark> which has a lower
        density, is the<br> top country
        regarding the growth rate in the world.<br> Moreover, a few interesting bubbles are pointed out below.

    <p3> Now let's analyze the population of the countries in<br> 1970 regarding their rank, growth rate, and their
        population<br> in 2022. The change between population in 1970 to<br> 2020 is observable. However, Countries like
        <mark class="china">China</mark> with the <br> most population in 1970 held their rank in 2020 <br> and small
        countries like <mark class="vatican">Vatican City</mark>
        stayed the same.
