    <h1 class="title">World's Population Visualisation</h1>
    <h2 class="center" > As the years go by the population increases significantly. <br> This visualisation examines each
        country's population in relation <br> to their density, area, and other attributes. First, have<br> a look at
        the population of the countries<br>divided by color. </h2>

    <h3 class="center"> Now let's take a look at a bubble chart <br> which represents countries' area and density in relation to
        <br>
        their population, global rank and, growth rate. We can see<br> that
        some high density countries like <mark class="monaco">Monaco</mark> have relatively a<br>
        small land. On the other hand, a country<br> like <mark class="moldova">Moldova</mark> which has a lower
        density, is the<br> top country
        regarding the growth rate in the world.<br> Moreover, a few interesting bubbles are pointed out below.

    <h4 class="center"> Now let's analyze the population of the countries in<br> 1970 regarding their rank, growth rate, and their
        population<br> in 2022. The change between population in 1970 to<br> 2020 is observable. However, Countries like
        <mark class="china">China</mark> with the <br> most population in 1970 held their rank in 2020 <br> and small
        countries like <mark class="vatican">Vatican City</mark>
        stayed the same.

    <h5 class="center"> Now it is time to look at a pie<br> chart of 10 most populated countries in the world,<br> Where each pie piece represents each country's area.<br> The chart below
        depicts some interesting facts. For example,<br>both <mark class="IP">Indonesia</mark> and <mark class="IP">
            Pakistan</mark> are very small compared to<br> the other countries but they are 4th and 5th <br> in the population
        ranking.
